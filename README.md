## Introduction

Notifications to the users

This module manages notifications, simple messages sent to the users by some
system processes. For example, that a reserved book has become available, or
that a batch job has finished importing 1000 users, with 27 errors.

A simple notification looks something like this:
```
{
  "id" : "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
  "recipientId" : "22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222",
  "text" : "Your item has been returned",
  "link" : "items/23456",
  "seen" : false,
  "metadata" : {
    "createdDate" : "2017-09-18 12:00:00",
    "createdByUserId" : "33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333"
  }
}
```

The important fields are the recipientId, the UUID of the user for whom this
notification is meant to, and the text.  There can also be a link to the thing
the notification is all about.

The most common operations on notifications are
*  POST a new notification to the system
*  PUT an update to a notification, typically to set the seen flag to true
*  GET notifications for a given user, typically with a filter for unseen ones

There is also an endpoint to post a notification with the userId in the URL.
This gets looked up in mod-users, and the recipient UUID is inserted in the
notification.

`POST /patron-notice` allows to send notices to patrons.

All messages are sent to mod-sender with `POST /message-delivery-notice`.
mod-sender then decides which delivery channel should be used (e.g. email).
